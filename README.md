# Week-1-Homework

## Description

A marketing company has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

On completion of the acceptance criteria the website will include semantic HTML elements, there will be a logical structure independant of styling and positioning, there will be alt attributes for images, heading attributes will be in sequential order and there will be descriptive title elements. 

By completion of the project the site should be more visible to search engines such as Google. 

Refactoring updates made:
- Changed the Title to the company name.
- Removed Div and added <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <article> semanticv HTML elements.
- Added alt descriptions to the images. 
- Removed numerous duplicate classes in the CSS.
- Added the footer h2 class into the footer class.
- Reordered the CSS to follow a more logical flow.
